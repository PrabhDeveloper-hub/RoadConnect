Phaser game

## Requirements
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via npm.

## Available Commands
**npm install** - To install project dependencies
**npm start** - Launch a development web server
**npm run build** - Create a production build in the dist folder

## Writing Code
After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:9000` by default. Please see the webpack documentation if you wish to change this, or add SSL support.

Once the server is running you can edit any of the files in the `src` folder. Webpack will automatically recompile your code and then reload the browser.
